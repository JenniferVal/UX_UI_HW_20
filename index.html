        <h1>Uncovering our user's problems</h1>
        <p>We began our research with a Testing Guide to clarify our objectives, and User Tasks. We also completed a Competitor Analysis with both direct and indirect competitors.

            We conducted a 6-question Survey, which we later decided was too broad after more narrowly defining our User Persona.
            
            Next, we visited Austin Zoo and noted our observations of the grounds, signage, and customers.
            
            Lastly, we contacted Patti Clark, the Executive Chair of Austin Zoo, and asked for her participation. She answered a list of questions that we sent her to complete our overall understanding of Austin Zoo.

            <h2>Through our research, we learned key problems within the site:</h2>
            <p>The layout had too much white space, text was small and dense, slow loading speed of the website was fustrating. Overall, the website is outdated.</p>

       <h1>Iterations</h1>
       <h2>The user feedback for our first iterations included comments that some of the prototyping connections felt confusing, and that some of the UI features needed cohesion. So, we then created another iteration, which featured A/B testing for the mobile design in the way that the information to plan a visit is organized.</h2>
